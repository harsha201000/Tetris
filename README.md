# Tetris
In the timeless tile-matching game Tetris, players control falling Tetriminos, or geometric shapes, to form uninterrupted horizontal lines. Tetris is a basic yet addictive game that tests players' reflexes and spatial understanding as they try to clear lines and avoid piling the blocks too high in order to increase their score.
